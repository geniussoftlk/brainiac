# The Basics

### Filing a bug

**For bugs** be sure to search existing issues first. Include steps to consistently reproduce the
problem, actual vs. expected results, and your OS and Brainiac version number.

**For feature requests** please first check our [issues](https://github.com/geniussoftlk/brainiac/issues) to
see if it's already there.

### Submitting a pull request

**Before you start coding**, post to the [issue](https://github.com/geniussoftlk/brainiac/issues) about what
you're thinking of working on, so you can get early feedback. We don't want you to do tons of work
and then have to rewrite half of it!


# Ways to Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to the Brainiac project:

* **Fix a bug** or **implement a new feature**
* **Write unit tests** for Brainiac.
* **Automate testing** with a CI.

Even if you're not a committer, you're still welcome to give feedback on any pull request!
